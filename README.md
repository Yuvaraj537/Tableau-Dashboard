# 🌍 Climate Season Change Dashboard

## 📖 About the Dashboard
The **Climate Season Change Dashboard** provides an interactive view of how climate indicators vary across different **seasons** and **years**.  
It helps analysts, researchers, and policymakers understand long-term climate patterns, track anomalies, and make informed decisions in areas such as **agriculture, energy, and sustainability**.  

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Climate change and seasonal variability have major impacts on society. Key challenges include:
- Lack of visibility into **seasonal climate patterns** (temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.).
- Difficulty in comparing **multi-year seasonal changes**.
- Limited ability to detect **long-term climate shifts vs natural fluctuations**.
- Manual analysis of raw data is **time-consuming** and prone to errors.
- Without effective visualization, it’s hard for decision-makers to act on **climate risks**.

---

## ✅ Solution Approach
The dashboard addresses these issues by:
- Centralizing **seasonal climate data** in a single visualization.
- Allowing **interactive filtering** (by year, region, or season).
- Enabling **side-by-side seasonal comparisons** (e.g., Summer vs Winter).
- Automating **trend analysis** across years and highlighting anomalies.
- Providing **actionable insights** for climate adaptation and policy planning.

## 📊 Visualizations
The dashboard typically includes:
- **KPI Cards** → Avg. Temperature, Total Rainfall, Avg. Humidity, CO₂ Levels.
- **Trend Lines** → Seasonal temperature/rainfall over multiple years.
- **Seasonal Comparison Charts** → Metrics across Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.
- **Year-over-Year Comparison** → Percentage change from previous seasons.
- **Geographical Maps** → Regional distribution of climate indicators (if available).
- **Anomaly Detection** → Highlights unusual heatwaves, droughts, or rainfall deficits.

---

## 📐 Key Metrics Explained
- **Average Seasonal Temperature (°C/°F)** → Tracks warming/cooling trends.
- **Total Seasonal Rainfall (mm/inches)** → Identifies droughts or flood risks.
- **Average Humidity (%)** → Important for agriculture and human comfort.
- **CO₂ Levels / AQI (if available)** → Shows link between human activity and climate.
- **Year-over-Year Change (%)**  
  \[
  \text{Change} = \frac{\text{Current Season – Previous Season}}{\text{Previous Season}} \times 100
  \]

## 🔍 Insights & Explanation
- Reveals **seasonal variations** in temperature, rainfall, and humidity.  
- Shows **long-term shifts**: hotter summers, milder winters, irregular rainfall.  
- Detects **climate anomalies** such as extreme heatwaves or droughts.  
- Supports **policy, agriculture, and energy planning** with actionable insights.
